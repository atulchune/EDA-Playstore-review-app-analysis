# Project Summary -
For any business to succeed these days, going digital has become paramount and getting an application for your business can lead it towards more profits. None of us can now imagine our lives without using apps in our mobile phones. Think of any problem you are facing in your life, you will find a solution of same in form of an app specially curated to fix the issue for you. As per latest Google Play stats, there are 3.48 million apps currently at the Google Play Store. The number is constantly rising as around 3,739 apps are added to the Play Store every single day.

Due to constant rising numbers of apps, it becomes imperative to understand the parameters and patterns related to app creation from a business point of view. The Play store datasets are quite intriguing as they consist of details like number of installations, app reviews, sentiment ploarity and so on. In this project we digged deeper into the datasets by doing an Exploratory Data Analysis to see certain patterns that can be helpful to different category of businesses.

We began by in-depth cleaning of the datasets and then we merged them to create one dataset. After that we did a generalised analysis to get numerous insights. We particularly focussed on the customer behaviour and what components affect the decision of the user to install the app. With the information gathered, we further tried to see if for medical category creating an app would be benefical. If so, what kinds of apps have a higher probability of being liked by the audience.
# Problem Statement
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Google Playstore in order to understand the trends and patterns in app downloads, user ratings, and revenue generated by apps. Our main aim is to structure the data and then see numerous patterns and trends across different features. We will do a general study of dataset through visualisations and draw some preliminary conclusions. After that we will delve deeper into seeing the scope of medical apps and also the consumer behaviour in cased of apps related to the healthcare/medical category. Also we will make final conclusions about the probability of the success of a new app based on the gathered insights

Additionally, the EDA will also investigate any potential biases or limitations in the data, and make recommendations for further research to improve the understanding of the app market on the Playstore.
